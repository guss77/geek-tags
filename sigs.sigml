    <p>Pi. :</p>
    <p>1.The Greek letter P or p, corresponding to the roman p.</p>
    <p>2.A number, represented by said letter, expressing the ratio of the circumference of a perfect circle to its diameter. The value of pi has been calculated to many millions of decimal places, to no readily apparent purpose: no perfect circles or spheres exist in nature, since matter is composed of atoms and therefore lumpy, not smooth. Nature herself sometimes takes to rounding off the more extreme decimals of numbers when they get sufficiently small, as Prof. Heisenberg has pointed out. However, the continued extension of pi provides a harmless exercise of computer power which would otherwise be misused playing Quake or surfing pointless web sites.</p>

    <p>Everything you've learned in school as "obvious" becomes less and less obvious as you begin to study the universe. For example, there are no solids in the universe. There's not even a suggestion of a solid. There are no absolute continuums. There are no surfaces. There are no straight lines.</p>

    <p>The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant. This also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.</p>

The larger of the two had the following record: the Vietnam War, Watergate, double- digit inflation, fuel and energy shortages, bankrupt airlines, and the 8-cent postcard. The second was responsible for such things as the transistor, the solar cell, lasers, synthetic crystals, high fidelity stereo recording, sound motion pictures, radio astronomy, negative feedback, magnetic tape, magnetic "bubbles", electronic switching systems, microwave radio and TV relay systems, information theory, the first electrical digital computer, and the first communications satellite. Guess which one got to tell the other how to run the telephone business? </p>

    <p>Actually, Posix requires that leap seconds be ignored; see IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993  section 2.2.2.106 (page 22 lines 448-458). There is some excellent doublespeak attempting to justify this in the annexes; my favorite is "it is inappropriate to require that a time represented as seconds since the Epoch precisely represent the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch'' (section B.2.2.2 page 306 lines 620-622). </p>

She also writes: "Pretty graphical interfaces are commonly called user-friendly. But they are not really your friends. Underlying every user-friendly interface is terrific contempt for the humans who will use it. ...to build a crash-proof system, the designer must be able to imagine--and disallow--the dumbest action possible. He or she has to think of every single stupid thing a human being could do. Gradually, over months and years, the designer's mind creates a construct of the user as an imbecile. This image is necessary. No crash-proof system can be built unless it is made for an idiot." </p>

    <p>Dear Mister Language Person: What is the purpose of the apostrophe? </p>
    <p>Answer: The apostrophe is used mainly in hand-lettered small business signs to alert the reader than an "S" is coming up at the end of a word, as in: WE DO NOT EXCEPT PERSONAL CHECK'S, or: NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ITEM'S. Another important grammar concept to bear in mind when creating hand- lettered small-business signs is that you should put quotation marks around random words for decoration, as in "TRY" OUR HOT DOG'S, or even TRY "OUR" HOT DOG'S. </p>

There is the truth you tell to your general circle of friends and family members.  There is the truth you tell to only one or two people in your entire life.  There is the truth you tell to yourself.</p>
    <p>And finally, there is the truth that you do not admit even to yourself.  And it's that fifth truth that provides some of the most interesting drama.....</p>

    <p>There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to design: an accounting package or an operating system?"</p>
    <p>"An operating system," replied the programmer.</p>
    <p>The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system," he said.</p>
    <p>"Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package, the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different </p>
    <p>ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside appearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system is easier to design."</p>
    <p>The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but which is easier to debug?"</p>
    <p>The programmer made no reply.</p>

    <p>        To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ. Usually abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to frob a frob." See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.</p>

But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable:  "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last bug."</p>

  <signature>
    <p>... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting down, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and never when standing.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though, know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to hypothesize: was there a loose wire under the carpet, or problems with static electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.</p>
    <p>An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard: the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led astray by hunting and pecking.</p>

    <p>Dear Emily:</p>
    <p>	I'm still confused as to what groups articles should be posted to.  How about an example?</p>
    <p>		-- Still Confused</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Dear Still:</p>
    <p>	Ok.  Let's say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think rec.sport.hockey would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be interested.  This is a big trade!  Since it's a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy as well.  If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.</p>
    <p>	The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics. He is a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post to soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn't exist, so cross-post to news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles there, and a "comp" group will propagate your article further.)</p>
    <p>	You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each group.  If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some newsreaders will only show the the article to the reader once!  Don't tolerate this.</p>

    <p>  A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling -- by Mark Twain</p>
    <p>For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.</p>
    <p>Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants.

    <p>THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10 -- SIMPLE</p>
    <p/>
    <p>SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming Language Environment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College for Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code with errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN, END and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make a syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.  Thus they achieve the results of programs written in other languages without the tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.</p>

    <p>THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17 -- SARTRE</p>
    <p/>
    <p>        Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely unstructured language.  Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just are.  Thus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions.  SARTRE programmers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at parties.</p>

    <p>THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18 -- C-</p>
    <p/>
    <p>This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is best described as a "low-level" programming language.  In fact, the language generally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to execute a given task.  In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.</p>

    <p>I remember once being on a station platform in Cleveland at four in the morning.  A black porter was carrying my bags, and as we were waiting for the train to come in, he said to me: "Excuse me, Mr. Cooke, I don't want to invade your privacy, but I have a bet with a friend of mine.  Who composed the opening theme music of 'Omnibus'?  My friend said Virgil Thomson."  </p>
    <p>I asked him, "What do you say?" He replied, "I say Aaron Copeland." I said, "You're right."  The porter said,  "I knew Thomson doesn't write counterpoint that way."  I told that to a network president, and he was deeply unimpressed.</p>

    <p>Dear Miss Manners:</p>
    <p>I carry a big black umbrella, even if there's just a thirty percent chance of rain.  May I ask a young lady who is a stranger to me to share its protection?</p>
    <p>This morning, I was waiting for a bus in comparative comfort, my umbrella protecting me from the downpour, and noticed an attractive young woman getting soaked.  I have often seen her at my bus stop, although we have never spoken, and I don't even know her name.  Could I have asked her to get under my umbrella without seeming insulting?</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Gentle Reader:</p>
    <p>Certainly.  Consideration for those less fortunate than you is always proper, although it would be more convincing if you stopped babbling about how attractive she is.  In order not to give Good Samaritanism a bad name, Miss Manners asks you to allow her two or three rainy days of unmolested protection before making your attack.</p>

    <p>As stated above, the host area of a disk is structured as a vector of logical blocks.  From a performance viewpoint, however, it is more appropriate to view the host area as a four dimensional hyper-cube, the four dimensions being cylinder, group, track, and sector.</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>Referring to our hyper-cube analogy, the set of potentially accessible blocks form a line parallel to the track axis.  This line moves parallel to the sector axis, wrapping around when it reaches the edge of the hyper-cube.</p>

    <p>It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but it is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to organize the actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  The manager of architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I were threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.</p>
    <p>	The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more than the schedule allowed.</p>
    <p>	The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule. Futhermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs for ten months.</p>
    <p>	To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made the system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it added a year to debugging time.</p>

    <p>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth but supreme beauty -- a beauty cold and austere, like that of a sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trapping of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.  The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.</p>

    <p>It took a while to surface, but it appears that a long-distance credit card may have saved a U.S. Army unit from heavy casualties during the Grenada military rescue/invasion. Major General David Nichols, Air Force ... said the Army unit was in a house surrounded by Cuban forces.  One soldier found a telephone and, using his credit card, called Ft. Bragg, N.C., telling Army officiers there of the perilous situation. The officers in turn called the Air Force, which sent in gunships to scatter the Cubans and relieve the unit.</p>

    <p>Once there was this conductor see, who had a bass problem.  You see, during a portion of Beethovan's Ninth Symphony in which there are no bass violin parts, one of the bassists always passed a bottle of scotch around.  So, to remind himself that the basses usually required an extra cue towards the end of the symphony, the conductor would fasten a piece of string around the page of the score before the bass cue.  As the basses grew more and more inebriated, two of them fell asleep.  The conductor grew quite nervous (he was very concerned about the pitch) because it was the bottom of the ninth; the score was tied and the basses were loaded with two out.</p>

    <p>The black bear used to be one of the most commonly seen large animals because in Yosemite and Sequoia national parks they lived off of garbage and tourist handouts.  This bear has learned to open car doors in Yosemite, where damage to automobiles caused by bears runs into the tens of thousands of dollars a year.  Campaigns to bearproof all garbage containers in wild areas have been difficult, because as one biologist put it, "There is a considerable overlap between the intelligence levels of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists."</p>

    <p>I suppose some of the variation between Boston drivers and the rest of the country is due to the progressive Massachusetts Driver Education Manual which I happen to have in my top desk drawer.  Some of the Tips for Better Driving are worth considering, to wit:</p>
    <p/>
    <p>[173.15b]:</p>
    <p>	"When competing for a section of road or a parking space, remember that the vehicle in need of the most body work has the right-of-way."</p>
    <p/>
    <p>[141.2a]:</p>
    <p> 	"Although it is altogether possible to fit a 6' car into a 6' parking space, it is hardly ever possible to fit a 6' car into a 5' parking space."</p>
    <p/>
    <p>[105.31]:</p>
    <p>	"Teenage drivers believe that they are immortal, and drive accordingly. Nevertheless, you should avoid the temptation to prove them wrong."</p>

    <p>Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather for several days.  I was serving on the lead battleship and was on watch on the bridge as night fell.  The visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the Captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all activities.</p>
    <p>Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, "Light, bearing on the starboard bow."</p>
    <p>"Is it steady or moving astern?" the Captain called out.</p>
    <p>Lookout replied, "Steady, Captain," which meant we were on a dangerous collision course with that ship.</p>
    <p>The Captain then called to the signalman, "Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees."</p>
    <p>Back came a signal "Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees."</p>
    <p>In reply, the Captain said, "Send: I'm a Captain, change course 20 degrees!"</p>
    <p>"I'm a seaman second class," came the reply, "You had better change course 20 degrees."</p>
    <p>By that time, the Captain was furious. He spit out, "Send: I'm a battleship, change course 20 degrees."</p>
    <p>Back came the flashing light: "I'm a lighthouse!"</p>
    <p>We changed course.</p>

    <p>None of our men are "experts."  We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert -- because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job.  A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient he is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the "expert" state of mind a great number of things become impossible.</p>

    <p>At that time in London, those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to Wernher von Braun. We knew that each V-2 cost as much to produce as a high- performance fighter airplane. We knew that the German forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes, and that the V-2 rockets were doing us no military damage. From our point of view, the effect of the V-2 program was almost as good as if Hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament... </p>

This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.</p>
